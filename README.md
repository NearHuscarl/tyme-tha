## Getting Started

```
yarn
yarn dev
```

## What have you done so far?

- Scaffolded the project using ViteJS and setup routing, state management, and UI framework using various libs & fws.
- Structure the project to be more scalable and maintainable at the start using module-based architecture.
- Created a form on the left sidebar to filter the cards by multiple criteria.
  - All form fields are optional and the form can be submitted with no fields selected.
  - The form can be reset to its initial state by clicking the reset button.
  - The tags list is a multi-select field that allows the user to filter based on multiple attributes (theme & tier).
- Created a simple UI to display character cards in a grid.
  - The cards by default are not sorted.
  - The cards are not paginated. User can click the "View more" button to load the next 8 cards.
  - The cards can be sorted by price.
  - The characters are updated every 60 seconds using the current filters.

## What would you have done if you had more time?

- Add some kind of indicator to show the user that the characters are being updated.
- Make the UI more responsive.
- Maybe setup some unit & integration tests.
- More testings on the UI.

## How many hours you actually spent finishing the assignment?

Nearly 4 hours.
